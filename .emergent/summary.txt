The trajectory details the AI engineer's work after completing Checkpoint 7 (CP7), focusing on rigorous validation of the GreyOak Score Engine. Initially, the AI was tasked with testing the scoring engine on 50 real stocks using . This led to a series of attempts to fetch real data, encountering  rate limiting and connectivity issues, which prompted a fallback to simulated data. A critical turning point was the user's identification of a lookahead bias in the bull market backtest and, subsequently, a critical data error in the bear market test where Nifty performance was severely miscalculated. The user provided explicit instructions and a comprehensive AI Execution Specification for thorough validation using actual  data across different market cycles, resetting expectations for realistic alpha. The AI has just acknowledged this new, detailed directive to build a robust validation suite based on real market data.

<product_requirements>
The core product is a deterministic, sector-aware stock scoring engine for Indian equities, generating a 0-100 GreyOak Score across six pillars (Fundamentals, Technicals, Relative Strength, Ownership, Quality, Sector Momentum). It includes risk penalties, sequential guardrails, and assigns investment bands (Strong Buy/Buy/Hold/Avoid). The system uses Python 3.10+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Pydantic, Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy, with YAML configuration and >80% Pytest coverage. Production readiness (CP7) has been achieved, including Docker/DB hardening, API security, and extensive documentation.

Following CP7, the product requirements evolved to include rigorous validation:
- **Real-world data testing**: Utilize actual market data (e.g., from ) for all validation tests.
- **Historical Backtesting**: Conduct tests across diverse market conditions (bull, bear, crash, sideways) with proper lookahead bias prevention.
- **Pillar Logic Validation**: Verify that individual pillar scores logically correlate with underlying financial metrics (e.g., high Value scores correspond to low P/E/P/B, high dividend yield).
- **Quality Consistency & Stability**: Ensure the engine consistently identifies fundamentally superior companies and that quality scores remain stable over time.
- **Defensive Quality**: Prove the score protects capital during market downturns (lower drawdown, volatility for high-score stocks).
- **Quality Spread Analysis**: Demonstrate that the quality advantage (spread between high and low score stocks) increases during market stress.
- **Comprehensive Reporting & Visualization**: Generate detailed reports and charts summarizing validation results.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python web framework for REST APIs, now with security hardening (CORS, Rate Limiting).
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for score storage, with  and Alembic migrations.
- **Docker/Docker Compose**: Containerization with production hardening and multi-stage builds.
- **Alembic**: Database migration tool for schema management.
- **SlowAPI**: FastAPI extension for rate limiting.
- **yfinance**: Python library for downloading historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Pandas/NumPy/SciPy**: Extensive use for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and time series operations in validation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Used for generating data visualizations for test results.

**Key Files and Changes during trajectory:**
- : Explored to understand the  function, which integrates various data points and pillar scores. This is central to the scoring logic.
- : Explored to understand how individual pillar calculations are structured.
- : Updated to include  and  for visualization in the new testing framework.  was confirmed to be present.
-  (Created): Initial attempt to fetch 50 stocks from yfinance and run through the scoring engine. Failed due to data retrieval issues.
-  (Created): Script to diagnose  connectivity and rate limiting issues, confirming 429 errors.
-  (Created, Modified): Generated realistic sample data when  connectivity was an issue. It was debugged to fix an . This script demonstrated the scoring logic with simulated market characteristics.
-  (Created): Performed a 5-year historical test, validated score generation and distribution. Requires  and .
-  (Created): Summarized the historical validation test results.
-  (Created): Implemented Phase 1.5 for Value Pillar sanity checks, correlating scores with P/E, P/B, and Dividend Yield.
-  (Created): Extended pillar validation to all pillars, identifying an issue with the Fundamentals P/E ratio.
-  (Created): Script to specifically address and retest the identified Fundamentals pillar logic bug.
-  (Created): Phase 2A, tested performance in a bull market. Initially contained a lookahead bias.
-  (Created): Dedicated script to diagnose and fix the critical lookahead bias in backtesting.
-  (Created): Phase 2B, tested performance in a bear market. Identified severe data accuracy issues regarding Nifty's performance.
-  (Created): Script to explicitly confirm the discrepancy in historical Nifty data.
-  (Created): Attempted to download comprehensive historical data using yfinance as per user instructions, but failed due to connectivity.
-  (Created): Simplified attempt to download individual stock data from yfinance, also failed.
-  (Created): A final fallback to simulated data due to yfinance connectivity issues, which also revealed issues with scoring logic in a simulated portfolio context.
-  (Modified): Updated to reflect the testing progress and findings.
- **New Directory Implication**: The latest instructions in Chat Message 130 imply the creation of  and  directories within  to store generated outputs.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement the comprehensive GreyOak Score Engine Validation Testing framework (Version 2.0) provided by the user in Chat Message 130, ensuring the use of real market data, preferably from .
- Resolve the persistent yfinance connectivity/rate limiting issues to enable real data fetching.
- Address infrastructure-level routing issues (OPTIONS preflight returning 405,  returning HTML) as noted in the initial CP7 summary, which are external to the code.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was attempting to validate the GreyOak Score Engine's performance in bull and bear markets using historical data. Initial attempts with real  data were hampered by 429 Too Many Requests errors and general connectivity issues, leading to a fallback on generating realistic simulated data. While the simulations ran, they showed inconsistencies (e.g., negative alpha where positive was expected), indicating potential issues either with the simulation itself or the scoring logic under those simulated conditions. Crucially, the user intervened after the bear market test results, highlighting a massive discrepancy in the Nifty 2022 performance data used by the AI, rendering previous backtest results invalid. The user has provided a new, highly detailed Complete AI Execution Specification (Version 2.0) for a comprehensive validation suite, emphasizing the mandatory use of real data from sources like  for all subsequent testing phases. The AI has acknowledged this and is poised to begin implementing this new, robust testing framework.
