The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the GreyOak Score engine project. Following a critical requirement for a comprehensive implementation plan (Checkpoint 0), a detailed blueprint was created and approved, outlining architecture, module dependencies, design decisions, and a phased timeline. Checkpoint 1, focusing on project scaffolding, code enforcement tooling (black, ruff, mypy, pre-commit), Docker setup, core configuration, Pydantic models, and basic unit tests, was successfully completed and approved.

For Checkpoint 2, the user initially requested real market data via yfinance. However, yfinance connectivity issues led the AI to implement a fallback mechanism, generating realistic sample data. The AI then proceeded to implement the , , , and  modules, adhering to strict user-provided code structures and testing requirements. The trajectory ends with the AI about to create the integration test for the data pipeline, having completed the core logic for data ingestion, hygiene, and normalization.

The goal is to build a deterministic, sector-aware stock scoring engine for Indian equities (NSE/BSE) that calculates a 0-100 GreyOak Score across 6 pillars: Fundamentals, Technicals, Relative Strength, Ownership, Quality, and Sector Momentum. It must incorporate risk penalties, sequential guardrails, and produce investment bands (Strong Buy/Buy/Hold/Avoid). The backend is developed using Python 3.10+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL for time-series data, and libraries like pandas, numpy, and scipy for calculations. Configuration is strictly via YAML files, with over 80% pytest coverage. Key deliverables for Phase 1 include data ingestion (OHLCV + fundamentals), sector normalization (z-scores, percentiles), the six pillar calculation functions, risk penalty, guardrail logic, and final scoring. Data hygiene (winsorization, imputation) and sector-aware weights are critical. The system must use hard-coded guardrail order, specific banding thresholds, and log audit trails (config_hash, code_version). Implementation so far has set up the project structure, code quality enforcement, Docker, core configuration, and is actively building the data pipeline using generated sample data as a fallback to a blocked yfinance API.

**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Defines Pydantic data models for all input and output structures, critical for type safety and validation. (Created)
- : Responsible for loading and validating all YAML configuration files, providing type-safe access to parameters. (Created)
- : , , , ,  were created. These externalize all critical parameters and logic thresholds. (Created)
- : A script to programmatically validate the integrity and correctness of the YAML configuration files. (Created, tested, passed)
- : A script initially designed to fetch real market data from yfinance. Modified to include a fallback for generating realistic sample data due to yfinance connectivity issues. (Created, modified, executed successfully to generate data)
- : Documents limitations of the data source (yfinance) and the rationale for using fallback data. (Created)
- : Designed to compute technical indicators (RSI, ATR, MACD, DMAs) from OHLCV data if not already present. (Created)
- : Handles parsing and initial validation of the CSV data files (prices, fundamentals, ownership, sector map). (Created)
- : Implements winsorization, missing data imputation (using sector median), and confidence score calculation. (Created)
- : Handles sector-aware normalization, including z-scores, ECDF fallback for small sectors, and conversion to 0-100 points. (Created)
- , , , : Unit tests for these core modules, ensuring functionality and adherence to spec. (Created)
- , , , : Docker setup for API, PostgreSQL, and Adminer, including a PostgreSQL schema with the corrected  column. (Created)
- , , , , : Files for dependency management and code quality enforcement (Black, Ruff, Mypy) via pre-commit hooks. (Created, dependencies installed, hooks set up, passing initial linting and tests).

<current_work>
The project is currently in Checkpoint 2, focusing on the data pipeline. The AI engineer successfully installed  and initially attempted to fetch real market data. However, due to connectivity issues, a fallback mechanism was implemented in  to generate realistic sample data for 15 specified NSE tickers over 60 days, including various edge cases like small sectors, missing values, and specific data points for the RELIANCE golden test.

The following modules have been created:
- : For computing technical indicators from OHLCV data.
- : For reading and validating the generated CSVs.
- : Implements winsorization (1%-99% within sectors), imputation (same-day sector median), and calculates data confidence. This adheres to the exact code structure and logic provided by the user.
- : Implements sector-aware z-score normalization, ECDF fallback for sectors with fewer than 6 stocks, and conversion to a 0-100 point scale, following the user's detailed specifications.

Unit tests for  and  have also been created. The AI is immediately working on creating the integration test for the full data pipeline and running all tests to verify the completed Checkpoint 2.
