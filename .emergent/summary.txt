The previous AI engineer successfully brought the GreyOak Score engine from initial planning (Checkpoint 0) through data pipeline implementation (Checkpoint 2) and the calculation of all six pillars (Checkpoints 3 and 4). Key challenges included resolving Pydantic recursion errors, which required a specific version downgrade and field name corrections. The engineer also meticulously handled various data inconsistencies and edge cases, adjusting test expectations and implementing robust schema validation in the ingestion process. Each checkpoint was delivered with high test coverage (>80%), passing all unit and integration tests as explicitly requested by the user, and thorough completion reports were provided. The work demonstrates a systematic, test-driven approach to complex financial logic development.

The objective is to develop a deterministic, sector-aware stock scoring engine for Indian equities, generating a 0-100 GreyOak Score across six pillars: Fundamentals, Technicals, Relative Strength, Ownership, Quality, and Sector Momentum. The system must incorporate risk penalties, sequential guardrails, and produce investment bands (Strong Buy/Buy/Hold/Avoid). It uses Python 3.10+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Pydantic, Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy, with configuration via YAML files and >80% Pytest coverage. Phase 1 deliverables include robust data ingestion (OHLCV, fundamentals, ownership, sector map), data hygiene (winsorization, imputation), sector normalization (z-scores, ECDF fallback), the six pillar calculations, risk penalty, guardrail logic, and final scoring. Critical features include hard-coded guardrail order, specific banding thresholds, and audit logging. So far, the project structure, code quality, Docker, core configuration, data pipeline (ingestion, hygiene, normalization), and all six pillar calculations (F, T, R, O, Q, S) have been successfully implemented and tested.

<current_work>
The project has successfully completed Checkpoint 4, where all six pillars (Fundamentals, Technicals, Relative Strength, Ownership, Quality, and Sector Momentum) have been fully implemented, unit-tested, and integrated. All 15 sample stocks are scored, and the critical  (sector momentum z-score) is being tracked for guardrails. The system achieved 92.44% overall test coverage, exceeding the 85% target. The work addressed multiple issues, including a Pydantic recursion error that required a version update () and corrections for field name clashes (Wed Oct  8 14:44:51 UTC 2025 to ). Column name inconsistencies across modules and test data were also resolved to ensure robust data flow. The current task is to begin Checkpoint 5, which involves implementing the  (), the  (), and the  (), culminating in the crucial RELIANCE golden test and full scoring pipeline integration.
